    <p><em>The Lost Son of Catania</em></p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Public Reputation</h2>
    <p>Quintorius is a figure of quiet strength. To many, he portrays himself as a little slow, with a simple and straightforward manner. However, those who deal with him for any length of time often notice a fierce spark of intelligence in his eyes, suggesting a sharp mind intentionally hidden. He is known as a rare sight in these lands, a Loxodon wanderer searching for his past. In the Oakenfort region, he is celebrated as a hero.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Known History</h2>
    <p>What is publicly known of Quintorius's past is both tragic and mysterious. He speaks of a lost, peaceful Loxodon village named <strong>Catania</strong>, a place he claims was hidden from the world and blessed by the gods. As a mere infant, his home was raided by unknown assailants. He was stolen from his family and taken by the raiders in a wagon.</p>
    <p>His next clear memory is of being found alone on a road, the wagon he was in stopped amidst a bloody massacre. Dead bodies of various races were scattered everywhere, but there was no sign of his kidnappers, his family, or any other Loxodon. He eventually wandered backward along the wagon's path until he was found and taken in by the folk of a town called <strong>Misgrove</strong>, where he spent his childhood.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Known Goals</h2>
    <p>Quintorius's driving purpose is public knowledge, as he often asks questions on his travels. He is on a quest to find any trace of his home, the lost village of Catania. He seeks to discover what happened to his family and his people. He is also searching for answers about the bloody fight that seemingly saved him from the raiders, hoping to learn who was responsible and why he was left alive.</p>

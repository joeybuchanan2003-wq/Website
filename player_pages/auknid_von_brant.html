      <h2>Public Reputation</h2>
      <p>Auknid Von Brant is a figure of surprising contradictions. As a hobgoblin, he is often met with suspicion, and he carries himself with a rough demeanor, seeming to enjoy the violence of a good fight. However, this is balanced by his well-known feat as one of the "Saviors of Oakenfort" and his habit of healing those he has fought. He is ambitious and driven, openly seeking to become a world-renowned adventurer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Known History</h2>
      <p>Auknid hails from a remote island called <strong>"Devil's Commons."</strong> He and his mother were known in their community as herbalists who helped the sick. This changed when Auknid was 15. After he and his mother were attacked by raiders, his mother collapsed. In a moment of desperation, Auknid manifested a strange, unknown form of healing magic to save her life. When they returned to town, they were met with fear and steel, accused of being "necromancers" and chased off the island.</p>
      <p>They fled to the mainland and settled in the town of <strong>Thorvale</strong>. Some years later, Auknid befriended a well-studied Aasimar adventurer named <strong>Yorten</strong>. Auknid was inspired by Yorten's tales of magic and battle, and declared that he would become an adventurer himself—one with even more feats than Yorten and his party. Yorten laughed, telling him it would "never gonna happen." Months later, Auknid set off to prove him wrong.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Known Goals</h2>
      <p>Auknid's primary motivation is public and clear: he is on a quest to become a legendary adventurer. He is driven by the challenge from his friend Yorten and aims to one day surpass Yorten's party in fame, fortune, and feats of heroism.</p>

      <h2>Notable Feats</h2>

        <li><strong>Co-Savior of Oakenfort:</strong> Alongside his companions—Brother Rock, Quintorius Tusk, and Godzul Figiteer—he is celebrated for defeating the Cragfoot Goblins and saving the Grogger's Fest. A trophy, "The Saviors' Tankard," is now awarded annually in their honor.</li>

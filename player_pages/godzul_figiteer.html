  <div class="player-content">
    <div class="section">
      <h2>Public Reputation</h2>
      <p>Godzul, often called "Gadzul," is known as a wandering artificer of considerable skill, though he is famously... eccentric. He is seen as a bit goofy, known for his tendency to mishear common phrases (e.g., responding to "Look at that!" with a confused "Took a rat?"). He is friendly, but his mind is almost always on his work, often muttering about "lost designs" and "blueprints."</p>
      <p>He is also legendarily bad with directions. It's a running joke in towns he's visited that he could get lost in a straight hallway. This tendency to get lost is, in fact, how he seems to stumble into most of his adventures—including his celebrated arrival in Oakenfort.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Known History</h2>
      <p>Godzul is a Rock Gnome from the distant southern continent. He speaks little of his home, only that he left after a devastating war claimed the lives of his parents, who had never wished to be part of the conflict. Fed up with the pointless violence, he left his tribe, using his gnomish skills for tinkering and artificing to scrape by as he traveled.</p>
      <p>He eventually found his way to Oakenfort (likely by getting lost) and arrived just in time for the Grogger's Fest. There, he and three chance-met companions stood their ground against a goblin raid, cementing their status as local legends.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Known Goals</h2>
      <p>Godzul's life is driven by a singular passion: to rediscover and build the lost inventions from a rare book his father died holding, the <strong>"Scripta Artificium."</strong> He is known to spend all his excess coin on materials for these projects. He is particularly obsessed with a badly damaged page that, he claims, details a powerful weapon designed to "bring peace," and he is determined to one day build it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Notable Feats</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Co-Savior of Oakenfort:</strong> Alongside his companions—Brother Rock, Auknid Von Brant, and Quintorius Tusk—he is celebrated for defeating the Cragfoot Goblins and saving the Grogger's Fest. A trophy, "The Saviors' Tankard," is now awarded annually in their honor.</li>

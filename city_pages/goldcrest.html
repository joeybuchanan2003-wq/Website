  <h1>Goldcrest</h1>
  <p><em>The Golden-Creek Post</em></p>
</div>


  <div class="section">
    <h2>Lore</h2>
    <p>Goldcrest is a frontier outpost built within a large, natural clearing in the vast <strong>White Lion Woods</strong>. It is a rugged town of rough-hewn logs, its name derived from the "Golden Creek" it was built on, the site of a minor gold rush decades ago.</p>
    
    <p><strong>History & Governance:</strong> The town was founded by prospectors, but the alluvial gold quickly proved shallow. The settlement endured by focusing on the rich resources of the surrounding woods. It is administered by an Imperial <strong>Reeve</strong>, a direct appointee of the regional government who acts as judge, jury, and tax collector.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Geography & Economy:</strong> Located on the banks of the Golden Creek, Goldcrest's economy is entirely extractive. Its main industries are <strong>timber</strong>, felled from the dense surrounding forest, and <strong>trapping</strong>, providing rare furs (including the valuable White Lion pelts) for trade caravans. The gold is mostly a memory, with only a few stubborn prospectors still panning the creek.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Culture & Factions:</strong> Goldcrest is a town of loggers, trappers, and prospectors. The culture is practical, hardy, and insular. The main factions are not formal guilds but professional collectives: the <strong>Timbermen's Collective</strong> and the <strong>Trapper's Association</strong>, which bicker over land rights. A small garrison of <strong>"Wood-Wardens"</strong> represents the Reeve's authority.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>City Districts</h2>
    
    <h3>The Mill-Yard</h3>
    <p>The industrial and economic center of the town, built on the edge of the clearing. This district is dominated by a large, water-powered sawmill on the Golden Creek. The air is filled with the smell of sawdust and fresh-cut pine. Log-laden carts rumble through the muddy streets, and the Timbermen's Collective operates a large bunkhouse here for its loggers.</p>

    <h3>Trapper's Rest</h3>
    <p>The "downtown" of Goldcrest, such as it is. This is the main street, lined with a few essential services: a general store, a blacksmith, the Trapper's Association hall, and a pair of rowdy inns (like "The Gilded Pan"). This is where trappers come to sell their pelts and loggers come to spend their pay.</p>

    <h3>The Creek-Bank</h3>
    <p>The oldest, quietest part of town, located along the original gold-panning site. A few old-timers and hopeful new prospectors still live in small shacks here, sifting the creek bed for the last bits of gold. The area is looked down upon by the "productive" loggers and trappers.</p>

    <h3>The Reeve's Post</h3>
    <p>This is the seat of Imperial authority, and it is more of a fortified stockade than a grand citadel. It contains a small barracks for the Wood-Wardens (the town guard), a lockup, and the office of the Imperial Reeve. It's located on a small hill overlooking the Mill-Yard, ensuring the Emperor's interests are protected.</p>

    <h2>Key NPCs</h2>
    <div class="npc">
      <strong>Imperial Reeve Harland</strong> — A weary, practical man whose only job is to meet the timber and fur quotas demanded by the Imperial capital and keep the rowdy locals from killing each other. He has little patience for anything that disrupts the supply line.
    </div>
    <div class="npc">
      <strong>Bror "Broad-Shoulder"</strong> — The boisterous, unofficial leader of the Timbermen's Collective. He is loud, strong, and focused only on felling trees, even if it means encroaching on the trappers' territory.
    </div>
    <div class="npc">
      <strong>Silas "Long-Stare"</strong> — The master of the Trapper's Association. A quiet, unnervingly competent woodsman who knows the White Lion Woods better than anyone. He despises the loggers for scaring away the most valuable game.

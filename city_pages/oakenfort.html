      <h2>Lore</h2>
      <p>Oakenfort is a cheerful, bustling village, famous across the land for its ales. The "Fort" in its name refers to the original, sturdy oak palisade its founders built to protect it from the dangers of the surrounding woods, a defense that still stands today. The "Oaken" refers to the ancient trees that supply that palisade and, more importantly, fuel the fires of its famous breweries.</p>
      
      <p><strong>History & Governance:</strong> The town is governed not by a noble, but by a beloved <strong>Village Elder</strong>. The current elder is the portly and kind halfling, <strong>Milo Greenbottle</strong>. He oversees the town's day-to-day affairs, but his most important duty is acting as the master of ceremonies for the annual harvest festival, "Grogger's Fest."</p>
      
      <p><strong>Geography & Economy:</strong> Oakenfort is nestled in a fertile clearing, surrounded by dense woods. Its economy is almost entirely dependent on its legendary brewing. The highlight is "Old Grogger," a famously strong and sweet ale that is the centerpiece of its harvest festival and its most valuable export. The secret recipe is guarded by the Brewers' Guild.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Culture & Factions:</strong> The culture is one of community, celebration, and hard work. The entire village pitches in for the harvest and Grogger's Fest. During the festival, the village also hosts a legendary drinking contest. The winner is awarded <strong>"The Saviors' Tankard,"</strong> a trophy depicting the four heroes who once saved the festival from a band of goblins: a Topaz Dragonborn (Brother Rock), a Hobgoblin (Auknid Von Brant), an Elephantine (Quintorius Tusk), and a Rock Gnome (Godzul Figiteer).</p>

      <h2>City Districts</h2>
      
      <h3>The Town Square</h3>
      <p>The open, grassy heart of Oakenfort. This is where all public life happens, from daily markets to the boisterous "Grogger's Fest." It is lined with food stalls, game pitches, and a permanent wooden platform where the Village Elder addresses the townsfolk. A small, carved statue depicting the "Four Saviors" of the festival stands in the center of the square, a popular meeting spot.</p>

      <h3>The Brewhouses</h3>
      <p>A district that is a source of both pride and a constant, sweet, malty aroma. This area is home to the various breweries, malthouses, and cooperages that make the village's famous ales. The centerpiece is the Greenbottle Brewery, a community-owned building where "Old Grogger" is crafted under lock and key.</p>

      <h3>The Dells</h3>
      <p>The primary residential area, a cozy neighborhood of halfling-holes dug into a series of rolling hills and small, well-kept cottages for the human residents. It is a quiet, peaceful district of gardens and winding paths.</p>

      <h3>The Old Palisade</h3>
      <p>The original "fort" of Oakenfort. This sturdy, tall wall of oak logs encircles the town, with watchtowers posted at intervals. It is constantly patrolled by the Town Watch, who protect the town from the dangers of the surrounding woods and ensure trade can flow safely.</p>
